Feature: Hidden Links
  In order to clean up the user experience
  As the system
  I want to hide links from users who can't act on them

  Background:
    Given there are the following users:
      | email              | password | admin |
      | user@ticketee.com  | password | false |
      | admin@ticketee.com | password | true  |
    And there is a project called "TextMate 2"
    # And "user@ticketee.com" has created a ticket for this project:
    And that project has a ticket created by "user@ticketee.com":
      | title  | description       |
      | Shiny! | My eyes! My eyes! |
    And "user@ticketee.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
