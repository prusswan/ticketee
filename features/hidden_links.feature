Feature: Hidden Links
  In order to clean up the user experience
  As the system
  I want to hide links from users who can't act on them

  Background:
    Given there are the following users:
      | email              | password | admin |
      | user@ticketee.com  | password | false |
      | admin@ticketee.com | password | true  |
    And there is a project called "TextMate 2"

    Scenario: New project link is hidden for non-signed-in users
      Given I am on the homepage
      Then I should not see the "New Project" link

    Scenario: New project link is hidden for signed-in users
      Given I am signed in as "user@ticketee.com"
      Then I should not see the "New Project" link

    Scenario: New project link is shown to admins
      Given I am signed in as "admin@ticketee.com"
      Then I should see the "New Project" link

    Scenario: Edit project link is hidden for non-signed-in users
      Given I am on the homepage
      # When I follow "TextMate 2"
      When I navigate to the "TextMate 2" project page
      Then I should not see the "Edit Project" link

    Scenario: Edit project link is hidden for signed-in users
      Given I am signed in as "user@ticketee.com"
      # When I follow "TextMate 2"
      When I navigate to the "TextMate 2" project page
      Then I should not see the "Edit Project" link
